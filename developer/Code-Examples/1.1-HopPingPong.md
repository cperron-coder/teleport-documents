# A 1-Hop Ping-Pong Example

## What  this example can help you:

1. Build your dapp based on this dapp to make sure your business logic is working instead of worrying that your way to communicate with XIBC contract is wrong.
2. checks whether the source and destination chains can communicate. 

**Promise**: We make sure that our ping-pong gets upgraded as the chain gets upgraded to make you can always use it to check that the source and destination chains are interconnected. 

**How**: If an ACK packet can be heard within a particular time after the cross-chain packet is sent, it indicates that the cross-chain between the source and target chain is healthy. Otherwise, contact the Teleport team.
