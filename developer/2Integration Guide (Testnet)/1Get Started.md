# Getting Started

## Teleport supports different cross-chain approaches which include:

[1-Hop Chain A to Chain B]()

[2-Hop Teleport as Relay Chain]()

[2-Hop Teleport Agent Pool]()

Based on your application needs, you can pursue different development approaches with the corresponding guide.

## The difference between them

### 1-Hop Chain A to Chain B

This method allows you to transfer assets and/or messages directly from Chain A to Chain B. We currently support the connections from the following chains to Teleport Chain.

- BNB Chain
- Ethereum (Rinkeby)
- Arbitrum

Examples:

A. ChainA to ChainB specific Asset bridge with own liquidity

B. Peg Blue-Chip Assets on Teleport Chain

C. [Cross-chain contract calls](./../Code%20Examples/1.1-Hop%20PingPong.md)

### 2-Hop with Teleport as Relay Chain

This design is centered around the idea of scalability. Teleport Chain is used as the relay chain in the architecture of the design, this way, links between newly added blockchains and existing chains will not need to be developed.  All that is required is that the newly added chain connects to the relay chain (Teleport Chain). Via this design, applications can be built to send assets and/or messages between any of the chains supported by Teleport.

Examples:

A. Universal asset bridge with third-party liquidity

B. Cross-Chain swap/lend/yeild farm based on the universal asset bridge outlined in 'A'

### 2-Hop as a Transportation Hub

Scalability is also the center of this approach which enables applications to handle additional logic on the Teleport Chain as a relay chain and, more importantly, take advantage of the global liquidity provided by Teleport to execute transactions. 

In this model, cross-chain messages are re-packed through the Teleport network (developers need to deploy contracts on the Teleport chain to handle the transmit logic).

Examples:

A. Official Teleport Bridgeï¼š[https://bridge.testnet.teleport.network/](https://bridge.testnet.teleport.network/)

B. Cross-chain swap using Teleport liquidity
